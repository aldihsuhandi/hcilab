                    The Unconquered Viking, The Great Bear
                    <br><br>
                    “I speak, you noble vikings, of a warrior who surpassed you all. I tell of a great bear-man who overcame 
                    giants and armies, and of how he came to leave our world and challenge the Gods.”   
                    – The Saga of Bödvar Bearson, first stanza

                    <br><br>
                    “Listen you nine-mothered bridge troll, I’m coming in, and the first beer I’m drinking is the one in your fist.”  – 
                    Bödvar to Heimdall, guardian of the gates of Asgard

                    
                    <br><br>
                    Born of a viking mother and bear father, Bödvar grew up feared and mistrusted by his own people.
                    <br><br>
                    Bödvar’s first nemesis was the terrible giant bear Grothnar, his own brother. By defeating Grothnar in a battle that lasted seven days, Bödvar chose to side with humanity and became the protector of the people of the north. He led his Skandian people against the Witch Queen of Helheim, slew the White Dragon Sorcerer, and lived the life of an all-conquering hero.
                    <br><br>
                    After he single-handedly ended the Giant Wars by trapping the fire giant king in his own volcano, Bödvar sensed his work was done. But he felt doomed to never be taken by the Valkyries to Valhalla because he could never manage to be defeated in battle. So he travelled to Asgard himself, broke down the doors, and let himself in.
                    <br><br>
                    Valhalla is everything Bödvar hoped – an endless reward of feasting and fighting, with himself among its greatest champions.

                <div class="content">
                    The Marshal of the Old West<br><br>
                    “Reward ($5,000) for the capture, Dead or Alive, of ex-U.S. Marshal Cassidy Miller. Age 25, 5 feet, 8 inches. 
                    Brown hair and eyes. Wanted for dereliction of Duty, harboring a Fugitive Slave, aiding a Known Criminal, and Attempted Murder. 
                    Known companions include a Giant Cougar, a Twenty-foot Lumberjack, and a Cherokee Ghost. Armed and extremely Dangerous.” – Poster, Nebraska Territory, 1853<br><br>

                    “You just going to stand behind me looking all-fired stupid or are you going to draw?” – Marshal Cassidy
                    <br><br>
                    When fifteen-year-old Cassidy Miller captured Wild Zeb and his gang, Zeb insisted his gun jammed and the sun was in his eyes. But, outlaws soon changed their tune, and just five years later, Bloody Cal Johnson bragged from prison that Utah had been forced to call in the great Marshal Cassidy just to bring him down.
                    <br><br>
                    In her long career, Cassidy’s insistence on justice for all earned her many unlikely friends, including “the meanest horse in the West,” a giant cougar named Boots. But it also put her on the wrong side of the law when she joined the Underground Railroad and became a wanted fugitive herself. Later, Cassidy returned to law enforcement in dramatic style when President Lincoln begged her to track down the Bloodfang Rangers, a company of Confederate Vampires.
                    <br><br>
                    To Cassidy, Valhalla is like any other frontier boomtown in need of her rough brand of Justice. She’s always on the lookout for suspicious types and reckons that trouble’s brewing.

                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <br>
                    “Lord Vraxx we adore thee. So strong and smart and great.
                    Don’t shoot or fry or jail us. Don’t crush or immolate.
                    Don’t chop us into pieces. Don’t throw us in the bay.
                    We’re loyal, true and faithful. You’re looking great today.”
                                                – 241st stanza of the Vraxxian Imperial Anthem”
                    <br><br>
                    “Now, Lance Starchampion, I’ve beaten you at laser sword dueling, just as I have beaten you at everything else. But I will keep you alive long enough to witness my final victory.”  – Lord Vraxx
                    <br><br>
                    Vraxx’s father was Governor-Tyrant of the Ice Planet Roldakk-9, and young Vraxx spent his childhood like most Zhaktari noblespawn – in a vat. As a cadet pilot in the Zhaktar Academy for Conquest and Subjugation, he excelled in space dogfighting, spacedog fighting, judging the weak, and planetary immolation.
                    <br><br>
                    As a young warlord, Vraxx destroyed Roldakk for harboring his childhood piano teacher, and soon built an impressive empire through fear, intimidation, brilliant space combat, and fear.  However, Vraxx’s extraordinary military prowess was always undermined by overconfidence, grandstanding, gloating, unworkable revenge plots, and general self-indulgence. He vaporized one planet because he didn’t like the color of their beaches, and disintegrated so many ill-performing generals that the rank of lieutenant colonel became known as ‘the sweet spot.’
                    <br><br>
                    In Valhalla, Vraxx’s naked ambition and unremitting scheming is reassuringly constant. He is contemptuous of heroes who are not royalty, and only Nai, Bödvar, Hattori and Orion are worthy of direct address. Vraxx’s most prized possession is everything he owns so no touching.

                <div class="content">
                    The Mysterious Stranger<br><br>
                    “Sir Roland swears Orion is the Gold Knight he never slew. 
                    Bödvar insists he is Thor in disguise. 
                    Gnash believes he is a magic rock monster. 
                    Lucien is moved to incoherent rage at the sight of him. 
                    I don’t care who he is, I just want to take him apart and see how he works.”  – Scarlet
                    <br><br>
                    “Here, I am called Orion.”   – Orion
                    <br><br>
                    Watching from the doors of Valhalla, Bödvar, Cassidy and the other legends saw a blazing trail of smoke cut across the Asgardian sky. Behind the fiery comet, a Valkyrie raced in pursuit, as though trying to stop the fireball as it plunged into the fields of Folkvangr in a gout of dirt and flame. The legends then watched as Valkyries and emissaries of Odin gathered around the smoking crater.
                    <br><br>
                    Weeks later, the Sons of Ivaldi, the same dwarven smiths who had forged Odin’s spear, quietly appeared in Asgard. They bore a suit of dazzling golden armor and presented it to the gods themselves. Soon after, the mighty Orion joined the feast halls of Valhalla.
                    <br><br>
                    Tentative and aloof at first, Orion soon warmed to the great hall and is now among its greatest warriors and most popular champions. Orion does not speak of his past, and other legends can only speculate. But Valkyries stop by his chambers to ask if he wants to, “you know, hang out or whatever, no big deal.” He is the only hero seen to leave Asgard from time to time.
